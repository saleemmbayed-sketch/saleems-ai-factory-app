/**
 * Updater store (Phase 15).
 *
 * Mirrors backend `update_*` commands into the renderer. Two consumers:
 *
 *   - `UpdateIndicator.svelte` — the title-bar pill. Renders only when
 *     `available !== null` AND Offline Mode is off (the second gate is
 *     evaluated in the component against `settings.effective.paranoidMode`).
 *   - `SettingsSectionUpdates.svelte` — the Settings → Network →
 *     Updates subsection. Owns the manual "Check for updates now"
 *     button, the auto-check toggle, and the install action.
 *
 * **No update info on disk in this store.** The skip-list, last-checked
 * timestamp, and the cached "available" entry all live on the backend
 * inside `settings.json`. This store just shadows the most recent
 * outcome so the UI doesn't have to re-IPC on every render.
 *
 * Failure modes handled here (everything else propagates to the caller):
 *
 *   - `paranoid_mode_blocked` → swallowed silently into `available = null`
 *     because the indicator must hide in Offline Mode anyway, and the
 *     Settings card shows its own "Disabled by Offline Mode" tooltip
 *     on the button.
 *   - any other `AppError` → stored on `error` for the Settings card
 *     to surface inline with a "Try again" button.
