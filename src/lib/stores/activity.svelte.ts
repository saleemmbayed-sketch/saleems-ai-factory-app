/**
 * Activity store — a JOURNAL of discrete agent actions (install, remove,
 * update, track, tool default-target switch, sync, bulk ops).
 *
 * Drives the "Activity" view. This is NOT a live stream: each entry is a
 * single, already-resolved record appended after a backend action returns.
 * Entries are clearable.
 *
 * Persistence: the journal is mirrored to localStorage so the Activity view
 * survives app restarts. The cap keeps the mirror bounded; older entries drop
 * off the tail. On any persist failure we console-warn (NOT a silent swallow)
 * so a regression — quota exhaustion, serialization failure, a webview-side
 * storage policy quirk — is visible during dev/testing instead of presenting
 * as "the activity log silently empties."
