/**
 * Preset teams — app-bundled, curated squads of agents you can deploy as a unit.
 *
 * These are starting points: a "team" is a hand-picked set pulled from across
 * divisions for a goal (ship a mobile app, run growth, etc.). Each references
 * corpus agent slugs (`<division>-<name>`); slugs not present in the active
 * catalog are silently skipped at deploy time, so a preset degrades gracefully.
 *
 * Curated by hand and bundled (no catalog/network dependency). To add one:
 * append an entry with a Lucide icon, a brand color, and verified slugs.
