# Phase 15 — emit the in-app updater manifest for a released .app.tar.gz.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/release/publish-manifest.sh 0.3.0
#
# What it does:
#   1. Validates the version argument shape.
#   2. Locates the .app.tar.gz artifact at the canonical macos bundle
#      path. **The Tauri updater plugin's macOS install path expects a
#      gzipped tar of the .app bundle — NOT the .dmg.** Feeding it a
#      .dmg results in an "invalid gzip" error on every install attempt.
#      The .dmg is still uploaded to GitHub Releases for fresh installs;
#      only the auto-updater path needs the .app.tar.gz.
#   3. Computes the artifact's SHA-256 digest.
#   4. Reads the .sig file the Tauri build already produced beside the
#      artifact (the bundler runs minisign-via-TAURI_SIGNING_* during
#      `npm run tauri build` — see `tools/build/sign-and-notarize.sh`).
#      We do NOT re-sign here: doing so would produce a minisign-native
#      .minisig that the Tauri plugin's verification path doesn't accept.
#      The Tauri-format .sig is what the embedded pubkey was generated
#      to verify against.
#   5. Emits dist/updater.json with the shape the Tauri updater
#      plugin expects:
#        {
#          "version": "0.3.0",
#          "notes": "<release notes — empty placeholder for now>",
#          "pub_date": "2026-05-24T00:00:00Z",
#          "platforms": {
#            "darwin-aarch64": {
#              "signature": "<contents of .app.tar.gz.sig, single-line>",
#              "url": "<github release asset URL of the .app.tar.gz>",
#              "sha256": "<artifact digest>"
#            }
#          }
#        }
#   6. Echoes (but does NOT execute) the rsync command the user runs
#      to publish the manifest to saleems-ai-factory.app via
#      umacbookpro:Sites/agency-agents/updater.json (the Caddy docroot
#      for saleems-ai-factory.app). Publishing is a
#      deliberate manual step.
#
# What it does NOT do:
#   - Generate the minisign keypair (one-time setup, see BUILD.md).
#   - Re-sign the artifact (Tauri's bundler already did via TAURI_SIGNING_*).
#   - Publish to the CDN (the rsync is the user's call).
#   - Build the artifact (npm run tauri build is upstream of this).
#   - Update CHANGELOG.md or push the git tag.
#   - Upload the .app.tar.gz to GitHub Releases (the user attaches it
#     to the `gh release create` invocation, alongside the .dmg).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — manifest written successfully
#   1  — usage error
#   2  — artifact or .sig missing
#   3  — sha256 tooling missing
