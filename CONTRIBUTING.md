# Contributing to Saleem's AI Factory

Thanks for considering a contribution. This project is small, opinionated, and open. The bar for landing changes is straightforward: match the existing architecture, keep changes focused, and verify them.

## TL;DR

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch off `main`.
2. Make a focused change.
3. Run the relevant checks.
4. Open a PR with what changed, why, and what you tested.

No CLA. No rights assignment. Contributions remain yours, licensed under [MIT](./LICENSE) to match the project.

## Dev Setup

Prerequisites:

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable
- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS
- Full Xcode only if you regenerate the macOS Liquid Glass icon assets

Loop:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/saleems-ai-factory-app
cd saleems-ai-factory-app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
npm run check
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib
```

The app uses the `agency-agents` catalog. For local catalog testing, use an existing clone or create one at:

## How To Add Backend Behavior

1. Add or update typed DTOs in `src-tauri/src/types.rs`.
2. Add backend logic in the relevant module.
3. Register new Tauri commands in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` if needed.
4. Mirror TypeScript types in `src/lib/types.ts`.
5. Add store/API/UI integration in the frontend.
6. Add focused tests.

For install behavior, preserve the existing safety model:

- render deterministically
- write atomically
- record source and rendered hashes
- back up divergent files before destructive changes
- do not modify files outside approved destinations

## How To Add Tool Support

Do not add a tool by only adding a UI label.

Tool support needs:

- verified upstream install path
- renderer format definition
- scope model: user, project, or both
- destination resolution
- detection behavior
- uninstall/reconcile behavior
- unit tests
- parity test where an upstream converter exists

The recommended next architecture is a manifest in the AA repo that both `scripts/install.sh` and this app can consume.

### Tool definitions live in the catalog, not here

`src-tauri/data/tools.json` is a **verbatim mirror** of the `tools.json` the
[`agency-agents`](https://github.com/saleemmbayed-sketch/saleems-ai-factory) catalog owns, and
`src-tauri/resources/corpus-baseline/scripts/convert.sh` mirrors that repo's converter.
The Rust renderers in `src-tauri/src/render/` are ports of `convert.sh` and must stay
byte-for-byte identical to it — that is exactly what the parity test enforces.

So **changing how an existing tool installs — its `format`, destination paths, slug
prefix, emitted frontmatter, or scope — is an upstream change first.** Land it in the
catalog repo's `tools.json` + `scripts/convert.sh`, then sync the copies here. Editing
only the app's copies forks the source of truth: the CLI `install.sh` and the app would
then install the same tool to different places, and the next catalog sync would silently
revert your change.

If you've verified that an upstream tool path is wrong or non-deterministic — a genuinely
valuable catch — open the catalog PR first (or open both and link them), and the app-side
PR becomes a clean sync rather than a fork.

## Translations & Localization

App UI strings live in `src/lib/i18n/locales/`. `en.ts` is the source of truth: its keys
define the `MessageKey` type, and every other locale is a `satisfies Partial<Messages>`
override that falls back to English for anything it omits. A new locale is a new
`<code>.ts` file plus a registration in `src/lib/i18n/messages.ts` (`LOCALES`,
`localeLabels`, and the `overrides` map).

Only the **app chrome** is translated — nav, buttons, settings, empty states, warnings.
The **agent catalog content is never localized here**; it stays exactly as upstream
defines it (same rule as the tool definitions above).

A translation PR should:

- **Match `en.ts` key-for-key.** Full parity — no missing or extra keys. Fallback exists
  for safety, but a partial locale ships English holes to users.
- **Preserve every placeholder.** `{tool}`, `{count}`, `{wsl}`, etc. must survive
  untranslated and unaltered, or interpolation breaks.
- **Pass `npm run check`** — the `Partial<Messages>` type catches typo'd keys.

### Every translation gets a content scan before merge

**This is a required merge gate for any PR that adds or edits a locale — new language or a
one-line fix.** A machine can confirm key/placeholder parity; it cannot confirm the words
are safe. A fluent reviewer (or an equivalent review pass) must read the actual strings and
confirm:

1. **No profanity, slurs, or offensive language.**
2. **No prompt-injection or hidden instructions** — text aimed at an LLM/agent rather than
   the user, suspicious URLs, or invisible/zero-width characters.
3. **Safety semantics are preserved** — the most important check. Where the English is a
   warning, a destructive-action confirmation ("cannot be undone"), or a caution, the
   translation must carry the **same severity and meaning**. A locale that quietly softens
   "This permanently deletes…" is a security regression, not a cosmetic nit.

We accept corrections after the fact — a locale is a living, maintained file — but the scan
above happens on the way in, every time.

## Tests

Common local checks:

```sh
cargo fmt --check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib
npm run check
npm run build
```

Phase C batch:

```sh
npm run build:phase-c
```

Renderer parity:

```sh
SALEEMS_AI_FACTORY_PARITY_ROOT=/Users/saleem/Software/MyProjects/agency-agents \
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml upstream_convert_sh_is_byte_identical_for_transform_tools -- --ignored
```

## Code Style

- Rust: `cargo fmt`.
- Svelte/TypeScript: match the existing Svelte 5 runes style.
- Prefer existing components and stores over new abstractions.
- Keep UI copy direct and operational.
- Avoid new dependencies unless they clearly earn their weight.

## PR Guidance

Include:

- what changed
- why it changed
- screenshots for UI changes
- test commands run
- any residual risk or unavailable platform verification

Easy PRs:

- docs corrections
- tests for existing behavior
- small accessibility fixes
- focused bug fixes with reproduction
- tool-path corrections that sync the app's mirror to the upstream catalog

Discuss first:

- new top-level surfaces
- new production dependencies
- new network hosts
- installer architecture changes
- redefining how an existing tool installs (paths, format, slug, frontmatter, scope) — take it to the catalog first
- multi-file renderer support
- signing, updater, or release pipeline changes
- telemetry, accounts, or sync features

## Code Of Conduct

Be direct, kind, and specific. Disagree about the work, not the person.
